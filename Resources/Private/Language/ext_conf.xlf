                <source>OpenAI Secret Key: Enter your generated API key or generate a new one under https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiModel" resname="openAiModel">
                <source>OpenAI Model: The id of the model which will generate the completion. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5 for an overview of available models.</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiTemperature" resname="openAiTemperature">
                <source>OpenAI Temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiMaxTokens" resname="openAiMaxTokens">
                <source>OpenAI Max-Tokens: The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiTopP" resname="openAiTopP">
                <source>OpenAI Top-P: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiFrequencyPenalty" resname="openAiFrequencyPenalty">
                <source>OpenAI Frequency Penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.</source>

            <trans-unit id="openAiPresencePenalty" resname="openAiPresencePenalty">
                <source>OpenAI Presence Penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.</source>
